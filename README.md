# XREngine Inventory Project _(xrengine-inventory)_

This is a project that enables a database or blockchain backed inventory system. 
It provides the database tables, feathersjs services, user table integration, UI 
components and optional Blockchain-in-a-box connectivity.

The code currently exists in a partially implemented state, there are missing 
pieces and it needs a big re-thinking and refactor.

The previous implementation can be found here:
